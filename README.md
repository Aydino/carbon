# Carbon Analysis For Buildings
Within the scope of this study, 1191 residential/office project data were analyzed and the relationships between carbon footprint and construction features were examined. You can find data in the project folder. 


# Results

First of all, we should point out that the obtained correlation does not indicate a strong correlation with value.

Obtained results;

1- As the number of floors increases, the amount of carbon footprint per m2 increases.

2- As the building area increases, the amount of carbon footprint per m2 increases.

3- New buildings produce less carbon footprint than old buildings.
